## Cultural Software
*Creating a computational engine to code and run algorithmic representations of cultural software in Creative Work-Systems, optimizing Virtual & Physical Workspaces to faithfully transmit cultural treasures across generations.*

# CULTURAL SOFTWARE:
* The Good, the True, and the Beautiful;
* Code That Can Never Be Corrupted;
* Faithful Transmission of The Cultural Treasure Across Many Generations;
* Ex. The Art Operation @ The Historiotheque, Field Art, etc.;
* SEE ALSO: Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, etc., understood through the lens of The Metaphysics of Art Movements (more on this later);
* The "fictional" science of Historiomics which studies the "Human Historiome";
* There has never been a day without art, not even a moment when there simply were no artists working on some sort of art piece.  Movements are merely a kind of mental, spiritual software to help us understand art.  Artists are the best vulgarizers of the work that they do, understanding intuitively with great force, the intricacies of their vocation.  Artists are the biggest popularizers and populists.  They are also those that are recognized the least for what they bring to the world;
* __Cultural Software__ as I envision it, can run various Religions, Artistic Movements, Political Movements; it can run Philosophy itself, or particular Philosophies or Philosophical Movements; it can run various Doctrines within Religions; it can basically run ANY *__Cultural System or Subsystem__*; *more on this later*;
* I did a lot of work on this in a previous repository from 2016, called [*__Critique__*](https://github.com/antiface/Critique): The Stable Release v.1.0.1. of *Critique* said that it was *"a foray into truly Philosophical Software. An exploration of the Software Space of the Formalization of Philosophy."*;
* In 2019, I created a similar repository called [*__Catholica__*](https://github.com/antiface/Catholica), which was *"The Formalization of Spiritual Software"*;

*__CULTURAL SOFTWARE IN CULTURAL SOFTWARE SPACE @ THE HISTORIOTHEQUE:__*

In the expansive realm of Cultural Software within the Cultural Software Space, a revolutionary paradigm emerges, guided by the principles of [Historiomics](https://github.com/Historiomics) and informed by the interdisciplinary insights of "The Metaphysics of Art Movements." At the forefront of this conceptual framework lies the concept of the [Art Operation @ The Historiotheque](https://historiotheque.ca/), operating as a sophisticated [Anti-Operating System (AntiOS)](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/AntiOS) designed to encode and execute algorithmic representations of cultural software within Creative Work-Systems.

Central to this innovative approach is the notion of Cultural Software as the embodiment of the Good, the True, and the Beautifulâ€”a code that transcends the limitations of conventional programming to faithfully transmit the cultural treasure across generations. Within the Cultural Software Space, the production and dissemination of [moraltempcards](https://medium.com/signal-science/the-refcards-system-v-1-0-1-d705d47f4214), or historiotypes, serve as fundamental mechanisms for encoding and preserving the moral temperature of historical moments.

Drawing inspiration from the foundational concepts of [*__Critique__*](https://github.com/antiface/Critique) and the [Schizobot system](https://github.com/antiface/Schizobot/), Cultural Software emerges as an intricate network of interconnected subsystems, each running various cultural systems and sub-systems, including Religion, Artistic Movements, Political Movements, Philosophy, and more. These subsystems operate within the Cultural Software Space, optimizing Virtual & Physical Workspaces to facilitate the faithful transmission of cultural treasures across time and space.

The creation of [moraltempcards](https://medium.com/signal-science/the-refcards-system-v-1-0-1-d705d47f4214) within the [Art Operation @ The Historiotheque](https://historiotheque.ca/) represents a pinnacle of Cultural Software development, harnessing the power of artistic expression to capture the essence of historical moments and cultural dynamics. Through the lens of [Historiomics](https://github.com/Historiomics), these [moraltempcards](https://medium.com/signal-science/the-refcards-system-v-1-0-1-d705d47f4214) serve as invaluable records of events, sentiments, and societal transformations, contributing to the collective understanding of human history and cultural evolution.

Moreover, Cultural Software extends beyond traditional artistic endeavors to encompass a wide array of ethical systems and decision-making processes. Interacting Ethical Systems, as elucidated within the Schizobot repository, underscore the complexity of moral reasoning and judgment, highlighting the dynamic interplay between individual values and collective negotiations within society.

In essence, Cultural Software in the Cultural Software Space represents a fusion of art, technology, and philosophy, aimed at unlocking the deepest truths of human existence and facilitating the transmission of cultural heritage for generations to come. By embracing the principles of Historiomics and leveraging the innovative tools of the [Art Operation @ The Historiotheque](https://historiotheque.ca/), Cultural Software pioneers a new frontier in the exploration of cultural dynamics and the preservation of cultural treasures across the vast expanse of human history.
