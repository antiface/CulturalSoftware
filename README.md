# CULTURAL SOFTWARE:
* The Good, the True, and the Beautiful;
* Code That Can Never Be Corrupted;
* Faithful Transmission of The Cultural Treasure Across Many Generations;
* Ex. The Art Operation @ The Historiotheque, Field Art, etc.;
* SEE ALSO: Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, etc., understood through the lens of The Metaphysics of Art Movements (more on this later);
* The "fictional" science of Historiomics which studies the "Human Historiome";
* There has never been a day without art, not even a moment when there simply were no artists working on some sort of art piece.  Movements are merely a kind of mental, spiritual software to help us understand art.  Artists are the best vulgarizers of the work that they do, understanding intuitively with great force, the intricacies of their vocation.  Artists are the biggest popularizers and populists.  They are also those that are recognized the least for what they bring to the world;
* __Cultural Software__ as I envision it, can run various Religions, Artistic Movements, Political Movements; it can run Philosophy itself, or particular Philosophies or Philosophical Movements; it can run various Doctrines within Religions; it can basically run ANY *__Cultural System or Subsystem__*; *more on this later*;
* I did a lot of work on this in a previous repository from 2016, called [*__Critique__*](https://github.com/antiface/Critique): The Stable Release v.1.0.1. of *Critique* said that it was *"a foray into truly Philosophical Software. An exploration of the Software Space of the Formalization of Philosophy."*;
* In 2019, I created a similar repository called [*__Catholica__*](https://github.com/antiface/Catholica), which was *"The Formalization of Spiritual Software"*;
* As for the concept of "Virtual & Physical Workspaces", SEE: ["WORKSPACE"](https://medium.com/design-science/workspace-906aded7edb2), ["THE GEOLOGY OF THE WORKSPACE"](https://medium.com/the-painters-almanach/the-geology-of-the-workspace-8ba2b38bf815), ["LOGISTICS OF THE HISTORIOTHÈQUE"](https://medium.com/design-science/logistics-of-the-historioth%C3%A8que-446a0800d144) and ["Dynamic Task Assignment in The Creative Workspace"](https://medium.com/design-science/dynamic-task-assignment-in-the-creative-workspace-8fe8db8a272c), as well as ["THE SWITCHBOARD METHOD OF PROJECT-BASED, SERIAL ART PRODUCTION"](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/SwitchboardMethod) and ["NOISE IN THE WORKSPACE"](https://github.com/antiface/NoiseInTheWorkspace);

*__CULTURAL SOFTWARE IN CULTURAL SOFTWARE SPACE @ THE HISTORIOTHEQUE:__*

In the expansive realm of Cultural Software within the Cultural Software Space, a revolutionary paradigm emerges, guided by the principles of [Historiomics](https://github.com/Historiomics) and informed by the interdisciplinary insights of "The Metaphysics of Art Movements." At the forefront of this conceptual framework lies the concept of the [Art Operation @ The Historiotheque](https://historiotheque.ca/), operating as a sophisticated [Anti-Operating System (AntiOS)](https://github.com/antiface/Documentation/tree/master/METHODS/GeneralWorkflow/AntiOS) designed to encode and execute algorithmic representations of cultural software within Creative Work-Systems.

Central to this innovative approach is the notion of Cultural Software as the embodiment of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful—a code that transcends the limitations of conventional programming to faithfully transmit the cultural treasure across generations. Within the Cultural Software Space, the production and dissemination of [moraltempcards](https://medium.com/signal-science/the-refcards-system-v-1-0-1-d705d47f4214), or historiotypes, serve as fundamental mechanisms for encoding and preserving the moral temperature of historical moments.

Drawing inspiration from the foundational concepts of [*__Critique__*](https://github.com/antiface/Critique) and the [Schizobot system](https://github.com/antiface/Schizobot/), Cultural Software emerges as an intricate network of interconnected subsystems, each running various cultural systems and sub-systems, including Religion, Artistic Movements, Political Movements, Philosophy, and more. These subsystems operate within the Cultural Software Space, optimizing Virtual & Physical Workspaces to facilitate the faithful transmission of cultural treasures across time and space.

The creation of [moraltempcards](https://medium.com/signal-science/the-refcards-system-v-1-0-1-d705d47f4214) within the [Art Operation @ The Historiotheque](https://historiotheque.ca/) represents a pinnacle of Cultural Software development, harnessing the power of artistic expression to capture the essence of historical moments and cultural dynamics. Through the lens of [Historiomics](https://github.com/Historiomics), these [moraltempcards](https://medium.com/signal-science/the-refcards-system-v-1-0-1-d705d47f4214) serve as invaluable records of events, sentiments, and societal transformations, contributing to the collective understanding of human history and cultural evolution.

Moreover, Cultural Software extends beyond traditional artistic endeavors to encompass a wide array of ethical systems and decision-making processes. Interacting Ethical Systems, as elucidated within the [Schizobot repository](https://github.com/antiface/Schizobot/), underscore the complexity of moral reasoning and judgment, highlighting the dynamic interplay between individual values and collective negotiations within society.

In essence, Cultural Software in the Cultural Software Space represents a fusion of art, technology, and philosophy, aimed at unlocking the deepest truths of human existence and facilitating the transmission of cultural heritage for generations to come. By embracing the principles of Historiomics and leveraging the innovative tools of the [Art Operation @ The Historiotheque](https://historiotheque.ca/), Cultural Software pioneers a new frontier in the exploration of cultural dynamics and the preservation of cultural treasures across the vast expanse of human history.

- GOD IS THE ACTUAL, REAL HISTORIOSPHERE; HE IS AT THE ORIGIN OF AN INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL MATRIX WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF ORTHOGONAL BASES OF "PLANES"; HE IS THE SOURCE OF ALL EUCHARIST/BEATITUDE, AND EVERYTHING IS A EUCHARIST/BEATITUDE; GOD'S ENGINE OF ETERNAL CREATION IS A "META-HISTORIOMICS" COMPUTATIONAL MACHINE OR "MACHINE INTELLIGENCE; GOD IS A MACHINE;
- Life is a novelistic phenomenogy; my brain simulates novels-as-systems;
- I can simulate a dozen novelistic phenomenologies at the same time;
- I integrate these experiences moment by moment into a single experience of individuality or indivisible unity;
- Right now I'm experiencing the Seasons of The Heart Simulation and it's really great; I'm having a good time and it's all happening in exquisite detail, and it is extremely elaborate;
- "ANTI-HISTORY": People seem to believe the historical past never happened; in a sense, it never has; only the present, current time exists; the future has never happened and/or WILL never hapoen;
- Just as the present has "History" or the historical past, i.e. the "Historiome", as physical, material part of its underlying "epigenetic" and genetic "CODE", the Historiome itself has its own "INNER ANTIHISTORIOME", if you will, which predicts the abject failure of the present in living up to the historical past, plus the failure of the past to exist in the present; it includes other, future failures of the future to live up to the present (to live up to the past); it is the "antisynthetic force" which is the "RUNNING DOWN" and the "GREAT UNDOING" and "DISSOLVING/DISSOLUTION/DEGREDATION/DISPARAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING";
- The Historiome "CONTAINS" the Seed of its Own Antihistoriome; the Antihistoriome is the boundary and limit of the action/activity and natural, evolutionary development of History itself and the Antihistoriome; it is also partly the "negative space" or "ground" for which the Historiome is the "figure" or "positive space"; it is Anti-History and the "Anti-Archive", part of "HISTORY'S SHADOW"; finally, the Antihistoriome is a fundamental force of nature, call it a form of "DELOCALIZATION";
- THE HISTORIOME IS THE "SIGNAL" AND THE ANTIHISTORIOME" IS THE "NOISE"; SEE: Signal Science and Noise Field Theory;
- I have to find and develop a certain mastery over time; Seasons of The Heart, it's a celebration of the countless qualities of time, of temporal existence; that's why I'm so obsessed with History, historiography, Historiomics, the Historiome and historiopathies and so forth, historiotherapeusis;
- ABOUT TIME: Leibnitz said, "Time is merely the order of events, not an entity itself."; Einstein said, "Time has no independent existence apart from the order of events by which we measure it."; The definition from the dictionary says: "Time is a continuum in which events succeed one another from past through present to future."; "The basic element of time is an event. Everything is an event."; "Time is the occurence of all these events in sequence, one after the other."; "Time is a seties, or a succession, of events." (Ref. The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management" by Hyrum W. Smith, p.20 (Warner Business Books, 1995);
- Temporal Sequencing; in my soul, temporal events don't happen in a sequence; the course of events is either occurring with everything at once wholly in one (single) moment or events are all mixed up in knots;
- The Novelistic Phenomenogy and The Chronotope;
- RADIANT WINTER PARADISE; HOT WINTER BLOOM; COLD SUMMER OF DOGS; END OF SPRING; THESE ARE ALL MORAL TEMPERATURE READINGS; THE ARTIST’S MIND IS A MORAL TEMPERATURE "HYPERVISOR" OF THE "HYPERREAL" QUALITIES OF TIME" / THE "SEASONS OF THE HEART"; THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF SEASONS BECAUSE TIME IS CONTINUOUS, OPERATE ON A CONTINUUM;
- NOUS: "the eyes of the heart", the "noetic faculty"; "still while moving";
- Pilgrim of Solitude; The "Seasons of The Heart" Novella Series; "The Heart Alone"; "The Heart is of Resolve"; "The Heart's Purpose if To Love"; "The Heart Alone Knows Peace"; "The Heart Loves Stillness and Solitude"; "Keep Guard Over Your Heart"; "The Heart Knows Nothing of Blindness"; "The Heart Pierces Through The Depths"; "Purity of Heart is To Will One Thing"; "The Heart Has Only One Reason"; "A Divided Heart is a Heart of Stone"; "The Heart Gallops (Like a Stagecoach)"; "The Heart Has Gives Chariots of Love"; "Patience is of The Heart"; "The Heart is Bold"; "Prayer Quiets a Turbulent Heart"; "The Heart Remains a Great Mystery";
- General Concept of Tonal Center in Ambient Spaces/Local Atmospheres (and "Modes" such as "City-Modes" in "City-Of Templates" in "Cartography of Abstract Landscapes"; Index-Reference Resonance and Photo-Captures, in subjective experients too, as also in all artifacts as refcards/moraltempcards/moral temperature readings in generalized/formalized, systematic ogging/documentation practice; specific mentions of "Noisemapping" using audio sensors/portable audio recording devices to make field recordings on Field Art, the (Ancient, Sacred) Art of Atmospheres;
- "I will speak more about this soon, but for now, some recent PhotoCaptures, which will help make the point about a new concept of “Index-Reference Resonsance”, a non-linear experiential form of resonance, similar to a kind of Morphic Resonance (Ref. Rupert Sheldrake)";
- Speak of Art Production of Cultural Artifacts as Documentary Evidence of Axiology of First Witness (Testimony) of Truth; Experience as Crucible or Tabernacle; see; Inner and Outer Historiotheque;
- The Body as Temple, Historiotheque; Historiomics as Epigenetics of Population Histories and the Elaboration and "Sequencing" of the Historiome, as exemplified in The Painter's Almanach and one of its Expressions, The Seasons of The Heart Project as well as The Refcards-System;
- The Tonal Center as Virtual Equilibrium Point;
- The Tonal Center as Based On Lower "Infrasound" Frequency Waves;
- "Seasons of The Heart"; "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." (Ecclesiastes);
- Boundary turbulence between day-tight containers, between states; interface growth;
- Environmental scanning for weak signals of emergent properties/phenomena;
- BURIED ALIVE IN THE TOMB OF MY HEART; THE GHASTLY CRYPT OF MY SOUL; I REJOICE IN A FUNERARY PROCESSION DEEP DOWN INTO MY INTERNAL CEMETERY OR CHARNEL GROUND;
- I AM BURIED DEEP IN THE EARTHY CAVERN, IMMORTAL, AND I RISE OUT TO JOIN THE OTHER LIVING BEINGS ON THE SURFACE WHO ARE MORTAL; RISING FROM THE GRAVE GIVES MORTAL LIFE AND RETURNING INTO THE EARTH GIVES BACK THE IMMORTAL LIFE YOU HAD WHEN YOU INHABITED THE EARTH, THE NAVEL OF THE WORLD, FROM THE PRIMORDIAL NOTHINGNESS, BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, BEFORE YOUR SURFACED AND GAVE US HJMAN ANIMALS MORTAL LIFE;
- IT'S A MOUNTAIN RAISING UPWARDS FROM IMMORTALITY TO MORTALITY, THEN GOING BACK DOWN INTO THE INNER MOUNTAIN INTO IMMORTALITY AND IMMORTAL LIFE AGAIN, AS YOU WERE IN THE BEGJNNING;
- I BECOME MY OWN IMMORTAL, LUMINOUS SPIRITUAL BODY WHEN I GO DOWN INTO THE INNER MOUNTAIN, FROM WHICH I WAS BORN INTO MORTAL LIFE; THE CREATOR IS IN THE DEPTHS OF MY SOUL; THE SEIGNEURIE OF GOD IS INSIDE MY HEART, HIS DARK BLACK KINGDOM OF DOOM;
- I'M FREE-FALLING INTO ETERNAL SLUMBER, BURIED BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN, IN A MYSTICAL AVALANCHE;
- I CAN SEE HOW LIFE CAME FROM THE DEPTHS, AS I RETURN TO WHENCE I CAME INTO MORTALITY AS THE MAN I ALWAYS AM;
- WE BREAK BONES TO DRINK THE SINEWS - SWEET SUCCOR! - AND BURY THE REMAINS DEEP IN THE CAVERN, TO GIVE BIRTH TO MORTAL LIFE;
- SLEEP IS DEATH, DYING TO ONESELF;
- I AM BURNED ALIVE BY THE INNER FLAME OF TRANQUILITY AND REST, SOLID AS THE MOUNTAIN IS SOLID;
- MY EMBERS CREATE THE LIFE IN MY BONES; FROM DEATH COMES LIFE; FROM BURIED, BROKEN BONES COMES ALL THE ANIMALS, ALL THE SPIRITS AND THE SPIRITUAL LIFE;
- THIS IS THE RADICAL SYMBOLISM OF ANTIGOSPEL;
- THE "BASEMENT", ROCKY'S BASEMENT;
- GROUNDED DOWN INTO THE ROOT OF EXISTENCE; RELEARING HOW TO LIVE, HOW TO EXPRESS LIFE, FROM THE SOURCE, WITH SUBTLE ENERGIES AND SUBTLE BODIES CIRCULATING AND RECIRCULATING; MY BONES ARE THE MATRIX OF LIFE;
- Signal Science; The Human Soul is a Signal; The Seasons and The Passage of Time are Signals; The Physical Foundation of All Signals is The Primordial Noise Field of NOUS; SEE; Moral Temperature Readings, moraltempcards, The Refcards-System; Everything is Made Up of a Field, of Superimposed and Modulated Noise Fields; The Seasons of The Heart Are Oscillations;
